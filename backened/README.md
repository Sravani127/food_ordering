Each Document can have a Router, controller and a model

##### For an example of course

    ==> courseRoutes.js
    which contains the main routes from express
    ==> courseController.js
    which contains the appropriate method to access get, post delete etc.
    manage request and responses

    ==> courseModel.js
    which includes the business logic of the app
